**Prerequisites / Getting started
**svn r11143: http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo/svn/NEMO/releases/release-4.0
Put on the repository only the modified routines/files in the

My_SRC directory
EXPREF directory (namelists, file_def, field_def and other xml files)


**Installing
**The configuration is compiled using ./makenemo -r BYONIC
Add an annual mean ptrc file (ORCA2) so that users can explore the output of the model to compare it to their own results in case they don't get the same code version and revision.
